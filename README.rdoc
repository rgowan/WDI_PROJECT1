#Â GA WDI12 Project 1 - Beatbox

In my first project of my Web Development Imserive course with General Assembly, I was given the breif to create a self publishing music app built with Rails, using gems of our choice. 

I was instantly motivated for this project because i enjoy listening to music and i felt like this breif really gave me the oportunity to practice my css, something i gravitated towards during the first weeks of the course. 

**Beatbox is only available locally, screenshots are provided below**
